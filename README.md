# bouncingNotes
A simple musical web toy.

* **Click anywhere within the box** to create a ball that bounces back and forth horizontally. 
* The **slider** controls the speed of all balls and can be adjusted by clicking and dragging its node.
* **Spacebar** to clear the screen of balls.


The ball will play its note when it collides with the edges.
The height of the balls' position determines its note.





Balls.
